# R2DBC Sample Application

This repository contains a simple ([Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)-based) Java application. The application contains [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) dependencies, including [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Spring Data R2DBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc). 

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate capabilities of [MariaDB Connector/R2DBC](https://mariadb.com/docs/clients/connector-r2dbc/) and [Spring Data R2DBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc).

This application was used as the live demonstration in a [MariaDB Webinar](https://go.mariadb.com/21Q3-WBN-GLBL-OSSG-Unleash-Reactive-Programming-R2DBC-2021-05-27_Registration-LP.html?_ga=2.230885407.1007250852.1621861445-706426216.1609965524&_gac=1.27734478.1619720874.Cj0KCQjwsqmEBhDiARIsANV8H3aWS3PquCgfiIt-oP0XuLmENXrOOSQ0kCuQme1Iqv8FmpVJi-cwrSIaAjoaEALw_wcB).
